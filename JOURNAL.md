Started the research and planning process. Learned how the claw closes and figured out my dimensions. This is a project that I have wanted to do for a while, but never really thought into the specifics as to how it would actually work. Here are the resulting scribbles!

I also took a general look into cost, and I'm worried I might need apply for 350$ grant, but I did do cost estimates based on higher prices (to be safe than sorry) and combining it with some father's day coupons, I think I might still be able to make it work. We'll see lol. Next steps is probably the electrical stuff, cuz that's what I'm most worried about. 
Time Spent: 2.5 hours
